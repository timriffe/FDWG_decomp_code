# FDWG_decomp_code

This is a tiny repository to accompany a spontaneous talk held 3 Dec. 2021 for the newly-formed [Formal Demography Working Group](https://github.com/formaldemography/working_group).
In the presentation, I will refer to `tutorial.Rmd`, although you can view it in a nice form as `tutorial.html`.
